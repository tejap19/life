# Tiny Habits

## Question 1
The most interesting story or idea for me was the concept of "tiny habits" itself, which emphasizes starting with small, achievable habits that can lead to bigger changes over time.

## Question 2
To use B = MAP to make new habits easier:
- **B (Behavior)** = **M (Motivation)** + **A (Ability)** + **P (Prompt)**
  - **M (Motivation):** Increase motivation by making the habit appealing and aligning it with your values.
  - **A (Ability):** Increase ability by making the habit easy, reducing the number of decisions needed, and creating an implementation intention.
  - **P (Prompt):** Increase prompts by creating an obvious cue, reducing the time it takes to make the habit, and making it convenient.

## Question 3
Celebrating after each successful completion of a habit ("Shine") is important because it reinforces the behavior, creates a sense of accomplishment, and makes the habit more enjoyable, increasing the likelihood of repetition.
