# OSI Model: Overview and Functionality

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to apprehend and standardize community communications. It divides community communication into seven distinct layers, every with unique functions and protocols. These layers are:

1. **Physical Layer**: Deals with the hardware factors of networking, which include cables and switches. It is liable for the transmission of raw bitstreams over a physical medium.
   
2. **Data Link Layer**: Provides blunders detection and correction and manages node-to-node information transfer. It encapsulates packets into frames and ensures dependable transmission.
   
3. **Network Layer**: Handles routing of packets throughout network limitations. It is responsible for logical addressing and direction determination, using protocols like IP.
   
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures dependable information switch between stop structures. It manages float management, mistakes correction, and records segmentation, with protocols along with TCP and UDP.
   
5. **Session Layer**: Manages classes between programs. It establishes, keeps, and terminates connections and synchronizes data trade.
   
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates data codecs between the application layer and community. It handles facts encryption, compression, and translation.
   
7. **Application Layer**: Provides network services at once to quit-consumer applications. It allows services that include email, document switch, and network management.

Each layer serves a unique purpose and interacts with the layers above and beneath it. Understanding the OSI version helps diagnose community issues and design strong network architectures.
